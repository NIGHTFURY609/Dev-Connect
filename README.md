Dev Tech AI – Developer Trust & Collaboration Platform Dev Tech AI is an initiative to build a credible and secure platform that empowers developers and students across Kerala by fostering trust, collaboration, and opportunity. The platform introduces an AI-powered Developer Trust Score system that analyzes public contributions such as GitHub activity, open-source involvement, and portfolio strength to generate a dynamic credibility score for each user. This score helps companies and institutions identify and collaborate with reliable developers.

Another core feature is a Smart Project Matchmaking engine that connects developers with relevant projects or companies based on their skills, trust scores, and interests. This creates a win-win situation where students and professionals get meaningful opportunities, and organizations find the right talent efficiently. To ensure user safety and transparency, the platform includes a secure Complaint Management System with role-based access, allowing users to raise issues.

Dev Tech AI aims to become a trusted digital infrastructure that not only highlights the potential of Kerala’s developer community but also connects them with real-world opportunities and feedback mechanisms in a meaningful, transparent way.
