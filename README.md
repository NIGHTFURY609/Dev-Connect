## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or a compatible package manager
-   A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kerala-dev-insights.git
    cd kerala-dev-insights
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The project uses two parallel processes: one for the Next.js frontend and another for the Genkit AI flows.

    -   **Start the Next.js app (in your first terminal):**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

    -   **Start the Genkit development server (in a second terminal):**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the Genkit server, which is required for the AI features to work. It also provides a developer UI to inspect and test your flows, usually at `http://localhost:4000`.

5.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` in your browser to see the application in action.
